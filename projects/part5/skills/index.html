                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>
                    I have spent some of the past two years of my academic journey at the University of South Carolina 
                    to delving into the world of Java programming. This experience has been a valuable journey of 
                    growth, where I've honed my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of 
                    software development. Java, with its versatility and broad application, has provided me with 
                    a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering. Throughout my studies, I've 
                    learned to design and implement Java applications, gaining expertise in object-oriented programming, 
                    data structures, and algorithms. I've also had the opportunity to collaborate on various projects, 
                    each contributing to my practical knowledge of Java development. This educational journey has not 
                    only equipped me with the skills required for the field but has also instilled in me a passion for 
                    the ever-evolving realm of software development.

                <h2>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    For around a year, I've immersed myself in the dynamic world of web development, delving into the 
                    trifecta of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My journey through these core web technologies at the University 
                    of South Carolina has been an exhilarating experience, equipping me with the skills to craft responsive 
                    and interactive websites. With HTML, I'm working to master the art of structuring web content, creating the 
                    backbone of every web page. CSS has empowered me to style and design these pages, turning concepts into 
                    visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. JavaScript, on the other hand, has been the key to adding 
                    functionality, interactivity, and dynamism to my web projects. Through my coursework and hands-on projects, 
                    I've gained the expertise to create elegant and responsive web applications. This year of learning has 
                    fostered my creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, shaping me into a proficient 
                    web developer with a passion for bringing digital ideas to life.

                <h2>C++</h2>
                <p>
                    I've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of C++ programming as a novice 
                    student at the University of South Carolina. This experience has been a significant step in my educational 
                    path, where I've had the opportunity to explore the intricacies of C++ development. Starting from the basics, 
                    I've gradually built my proficiency in this versatile language, learning its syntax, data structures, and 
                    various libraries. Despite being a novice, I've already had the chance to work on some interesting projects, 
                    allowing me to apply my growing knowledge of C++ to real-world problems. Learning new skills in C++ has been a 
                    valuable foundation for my future endeavors in the field of computer information systems, sparking my curiosity and 
                    passion for software development. As I continue my academic journey, I look forward to expanding my expertise 
                    in C++ and exploring its vast potential for creating robust and efficient software solutions.
