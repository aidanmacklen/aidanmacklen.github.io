                <p>For this part of the project I was essentially picking out my
                    topic selection as well as laying out my goals and design of 
                    the webpage on a pdf in a nice format.

                <p>For this part of the project I was essentially designing
                    the layout of exactly how I wanted my page to look. I 
                    did this by using a wireframe which is very helpful.

            <section class="project">
                <h3><a href="https://aidanmacklen.github.io\projects\part1\pre-home\index.html">3. HTML & CSS</a></h3>
                <img src="htmlandcss.JPG" alt="Webpage Home" width="300" height="150">
                <p>This part of the project was the most time consuming by far,
                    as I was essentially just taking my wireframe from the previous
                    part and coding it into reality. It was very satisfying seeing
                    the final part once I was done (of this step).

                <p>This part of the project was pretty fun to me as I just got to mainly design
                    the page that I initially was thinking of. Now that I had gotten the main structure
                    of the page set up, I let my creativity run free.
