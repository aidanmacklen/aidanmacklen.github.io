                <p>For this part of the project I was essentially picking out my
                    topic selection as well as laying out my goals and design of 
                    the webpage on a pdf in a nice format.

                <img src="wireframe.JPG" alt="Wireframe" width="300" height="150">
                <p>For this part of the project I was essentially designing
                    the layout of exactly how I wanted my page to look. I 
                    did this by using a wireframe which is very helpful.

                <img src="htmlandcss.JPG" alt="Webpage Home" width="300" height="150">
                <p>This part of the project was the most time consuming by far,
                    as I was essentially just taking my wireframe from the previous
                    part and coding it into reality. It was very satisfying seeing
                    the final part once I was done (of this step).

                <img src="colors.JPG" alt="Colors&Pics&Text" width="300" height="150">
                <p>This part of the project was pretty fun to me as I just got to mainly design
                    the page that I initially was thinking of. Now that I had gotten the main structure
                    of the page set up, I let my creativity run free.

                <p>This part of the project was mainly just adding a fully functional contact page, as well as a 
                    page where the user can interact with directly. Not only this, but I also embedded a pie chart
                    on the Skills page using an iframe.

                <p>This part of the project was mainly just adding a JSON file for our images and iframes
                    if applicable. I don't have another list of items to add beside the images as that does
                    not fit into my website portfolio design, however I'm much more comfortable now with the 
                    use of json.

                <p>This part of the project was simply adding everything we've been learning about backend Implementation,
                    and combining it with the project which we had previously taken a break on. I have attatched the render
                    for the interactive page specifically while the rest can be easily scrolled through with the link attatched
                    to the title of this section
